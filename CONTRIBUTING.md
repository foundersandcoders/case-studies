# Contributing
Case studies should follow the [template](./template.md) and be added to this repo differently, depending on your stage in the organisation:

### Freelancing
Alumni:
- add your file to the `freelancing` folder
- name your file after the project

### Graduate projects
For initial projects created after graduation:
- add your file to the `grad-projects` folder
- naming: `[your cohort]/[project name].md` e.g. `fac9-breathewithme.md`

### Students
Projects created by our students as part of the curriculum:
- add your file to the `[city]/[cohort]` folder (e.g. `london/fac11/`)
- naming: `[internal]/[project name].md` for weeks 10-12 or `[clients]/[project name].md` for weeks 13-16
