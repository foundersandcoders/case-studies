## Summary

Gunboat diplomacy is multiplayer game where users can select a politician and roam around the map. They can shoot bullets, that collide with objects. They can jump, and they can play arond with other freidnss.

## Challenge

The main challenge was the fact none of our team members new anything about any of the technoligies that we were to use. In fact initially we had no idea how we were going to build the game. However, with optimisim and patience we were able to learn and deploy the technologies well.

## Solution

The solution was to use sockets.io to emit player position, velocity and rotation. We used the Three.JS library to build the scene, geometry and meshes. We used the CANNON.js library to build physics within the game.

## Technologies
socket.io (websocket technology)
Three.js (gaming library in javascript)
browserify (for bundling frontend files and modularising code in the same way as the backend)
babelify(converts ES6 to ES5 for use of frontend files in bundles made with browserify)
CANNON
express
node.js
heroku
