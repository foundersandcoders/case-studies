## Summary :pencil:
All About Me is a mobile-first web application which allows users to answer questions about their mental health and send their answers to their mental heath workers.

## Challenge :warning:
Patients at [The Anna Freud Centre](http://www.annafreud.org/) were tired of being asked the same questions every time their clinician changed or when they went to a new centre. They wrote up the most commonly asked questions into one questionnaire which they could give to their clinicians, however it was still paper-based.

## Solution :bulb:
All About Me allows patients to answer the questionnaire online in their own time, save their answers, and update their details as needed. When they're ready they can send their form to their clinician.

## The Final Product! :sparkles:
