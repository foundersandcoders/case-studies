# Boatlaunch Case Study

>"Working with the F&C was a delight.  They listened to the brief and produced a realistic plan which was well executed.  It was only a two-week sprint and at the end of it we had a working App which gave us a great feel for what a final produce could be.  Lots of good ideas came out of the work and I would definitely use F&C again."

### Summary

Boatlaunch UK is a community-driven website which records details of boat slipways across the UK and some in Europe. It welcomes users to record slipways they have used or come across, and update information concerning slipways.

Boatlaunch already possessed a rather dated native application. Our brief for the MVP sprint was to build a prototype web application with a view to extending this to a native application later in the year, after user testing had been conducted.

### Challenge

The main challenge was dealing with a relatively large amount of data (or at least much larger than we'd dealt with before!) and presenting this in an intuitive, user-friendly way.

A further challenge was to convert our web application to a sample of a native application using phonegap.

### Solution

The Google Map API was really handy for building this app. It came with a lot of handy features including location autocomplete, being able to search by place name or longitude and latitude, as well as being able to plot points with custom markers. jQuery made building some of our front-end functionality quicker, and hapi was a quick and relatively simple way of constructing our backend. Firebase also provides a simple GUI to view data and equally simple commands to make database calls.
