# Wales Co-op Case Study

### Client Quote

>""

### Summary

We produced an online tool to help co-operatives get access to the business advice that is most relevant to them.

### Challenge

Wales Co-op is a charity that offers free in-person advice to co-operative businesses, but this is becoming too costly to provide in all cases. If businesses first consulted the advice available online, Wales-coop would be able to streamline its in-person services. The challenge was to create a tool that would help businesses quickly find the online advice relevant to them.

### Solution

We produced an online questionnaire and a portal for accessing online advice that responds dynamically to the questionnaire results. Animations and a smooth user-interface make the experience as painless as possible for businesses and a login system allows results to be saved.  In addition, we provided Wales Co-op with views of the aggregated questionnaire results to allow them to keep track of which information is most useful to different kinds of businesses.
