## Approach

### Design Sprint

More details about our journey through design week can be found here: 
[Design Thinking Week Journey](https://github.com/fac-13/stackMatch/blob/master/Design%20Folder/journey.md)

As a result of our design sprint and user testing feedback, we decided to focus on a desktop/laptop web application rather than a mobile-first approach.
