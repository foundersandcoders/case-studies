# National Ugly Mugs Case Study

### Client Quote

>""

### Summary

We produced a case management system for [National Ugly Mugs](https://uknswp.org/um/about/).

### Challenge

National Ugly Mugs is a charity protecting sex workers against abuse by tracking and prosecuting offenders. The challenge was to build a centralised system for storing and adding to information pertinent to individual abuse cases, and for tracking progress on tasks associated with those cases.


### Solution

We created a case management system with user accounts and the ability to enter new cases, search for registered cases, add notes and tasks to cases, and view pending tasks.


### Technologies

 - ES6 transpiled by Babel and bundled by Webpack.
 - Deployd for backend services.
 - React and Redux on the frontend
 - Materialize for styling.
